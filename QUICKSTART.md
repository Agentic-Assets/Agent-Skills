## Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### 1. Provide Context
Include relevant information:
- Language/framework you're using (Python, FastAPI, pandas, etc.)
- What you're trying to accomplish
- Any constraints or requirements
- Error messages (if debugging)

### 2. Ask for Multiple Perspectives
```
"Review this FastAPI code for security and performance"
[Activates: code-reviewer + fastapi-expert]
```

### 3. Follow Recommended Workflows

**API Development: Design → Implement → Test → Document → Review**
1. fastapi-expert (implement)
2. debugging-wizard (troubleshoot)
3. code-documenter (add docs)
4. code-reviewer (review)

**Data Analysis: Clean → Analyze → Document**
1. pandas-pro (clean/transform)
2. pyfixest-latex or stata-accounting-research (analyze)
3. code-documenter (document)

**ML Pipeline: Prepare → Build → Track → Document**
1. pandas-pro (prepare data)
2. ml-pipeline (build pipeline)
3. prompt-engineer (add LLM components if needed)
4. code-documenter (document)

**Business Analysis: Analyze → Model → Report**
1. pandas-pro (data analysis)
2. cre-investment-analysis (financial modeling)
3. code-documenter (create reports)
